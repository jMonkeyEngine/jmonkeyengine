package com.jme3.anim.tween.action;

/**
 * A provider interface which provides a value {@link BlendSpace#getWeight()} to control the blending between 2 successive actions in a {@link BlendAction}.
 * The blending weight is a read-only value, and it can be manipulated using the arbitrary value {@link BlendSpace#setValue(float)} during the application runtime.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Notes about the blending action and its relations with the blending weight:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Blending is the action of mixing between 2 successive animation {@link BlendableAction}s by interpolating their transforms and 
 * then applying the result on the assigned {@link HasLocalTransform} object, the {@link BlendSpace} provides this blending action with a blend weight value. </li>
 * <li> The blend weight is the value for the interpolation for the target transforms. </li>
 * <li> The blend weight value must be in this interval [0, 1]. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Different blending weight case scenarios managed by {@link BlendAction} internally:
 * <ul>
 * <li> In case of (0 < Blending weight < 1), the blending is executed each update among 2 actions, the first action will use 
 * a blend value of 1 and the second action will use the blend space weight as a value for the interpolation. </li>
 * <li> In case of (Blending weight = 0), the blending hasn't started yet, only the first action will be interpolated at (weight = 1). </li>
 * <li> In case of (Blending weight = 1), the blending is finished and only the second action will continue to run at (weight = 1). </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Notes about the blending weight value:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Negative values and values greater than 1 aren't allowed (i.e., extrapolations aren't allowed). </li>
 * <li> For more details, see {@link BlendAction#doInterpolate(double)} and {@link BlendAction#collectTransform(HasLocalTransform, Transform, float, BlendableAction)}. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
