/**
 * The <code>AppStateManager</code> holds a list of {@link AppState}s which
 * it will update and render.<br/>
 * When an {@link AppState} is attached or detached, the
 * {@link AppState#stateAttached(com.jme3.app.state.AppStateManager) } and
 * {@link AppState#stateDetached(com.jme3.app.state.AppStateManager) } methods
 * will be called respectively.
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle for an attached AppState is as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>stateAttached() : called when the state is attached on the thread on which
 *                       the state was attached.
 * <li>initialize() : called ONCE on the render thread at the beginning of the next
 *                    AppStateManager.update().
 * <li>stateDetached() : called when the state is detached on the thread on which
 *                       the state was detached.  This is not necessarily on the
 *                       render thread and it is not necessarily safe to modify
 *                       the scene graph, etc..
 * <li>cleanup() : called ONCE on the render thread at the beginning of the next update
 *                 after the state has been detached or when the application is 
 *                 terminating.  
 * </ul>
