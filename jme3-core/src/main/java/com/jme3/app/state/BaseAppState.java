/**
 *  A base app state implementation the provides more built-in
 *  management convenience than AbstractAppState, including methods
 *  for enable/disable/initialize state management.
 *  The abstract onEnable() and onDisable() methods are called
 *  appropriately during initialize(), cleanup(), or setEnabled()
 *  depending on the mutual state of "initialized" and "enabled".
 *  
 *  <p>initialize() and cleanup() can be used by subclasses to
 *  manage resources that should exist the entire time that the 
 *  app state is attached.  This is useful for resources that might
 *  be expensive to create or load.</p>
 *
 *  <p>onEnable()/onDisable() can be used for managing things that
 *  should only exist while the state is enabled.  Prime examples
 *  would be scene graph attachment or input listener attachment.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The base class logic is such that onDisable() will always be called
 *  before cleanup() if the state is enabled.  Likewise, enable()
 *  will always be called after initialize() if the state is enable().
 *  onEnable()/onDisable() are also called appropriate when setEnabled()
 *  is called that changes the enabled state AND if the state is attached.
 *  In other words, onEnable()/onDisable() are only ever called on an already 
 *  attached state.</p>
 *
 *  <p>It is technically safe to do all initialization and cleanup in
 *  the onEnable()/onDisable() methods.  Choosing to use initialize()
 *  and cleanup() for this is a matter of performance specifics for the
 *  implementor.</p>
