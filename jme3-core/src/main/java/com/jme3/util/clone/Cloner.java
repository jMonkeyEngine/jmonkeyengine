/**
 *  A deep clone utility that provides similar object-graph-preserving
 *  qualities to typical serialization schemes.  An internal registry
 *  of cloned objects is kept to be used by other objects in the deep
 *  clone process that implement JmeCloneable.
 *
 *  <p>By default, objects that do not implement JmeCloneable will
 *  be treated like normal Java Cloneable objects.  If the object does
 *  not implement the JmeCloneable or the regular JDK Cloneable interfaces
 *  AND has no special handling defined then an IllegalArgumentException
 *  will be thrown.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Enhanced object cloning is done in a two step process.  First,
 *  the object is cloned using the normal Java clone() method and stored
 *  in the clone registry.  After that, if it implements JmeCloneable then
 *  its cloneFields() method is called to deep clone any of the fields.
 *  This two step process has a few benefits.  First, it means that objects
 *  can easily have a regular shallow clone implementation just like any
 *  normal Java objects.  Second, the deep cloning of fields happens after
 *  creation which means that the clone is available to future field cloning
 *  to resolve circular references.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Similar to Java serialization, the handling of specific object
 *  types can be customized.  This allows certain objects to be cloned gracefully
 *  even if they aren't normally Cloneable.  This can also be used as a
 *  sort of filter to keep certain types of objects from being cloned.
 *  (For example, adding the IdentityCloneFunction for Mesh.class would cause
 *  all mesh instances to be shared with the original object graph.)</p>
 *
 *  <p>By default, the Cloner registers several default clone functions
 *  as follows:</p>
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>java.util.ArrayList: ListCloneFunction
 *  <li>java.util.LinkedList: ListCloneFunction
 *  <li>java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList: ListCloneFunction
 *  <li>java.util.Vector: ListCloneFunction
 *  <li>java.util.Stack: ListCloneFunction
 *  <li>com.jme3.util.SafeArrayList: ListCloneFunction
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Usage:</p>
 *  <pre>
 *  // Example 1: using an instantiated, reusable cloner.
 *  Cloner cloner = new Cloner();
 *  Foo fooClone = cloner.clone(foo);
 *  cloner.clearIndex(); // prepare it for reuse
 *  Foo fooClone2 = cloner.clone(foo);
 *
 *  // Example 2: using the utility method that self-instantiates a temporary cloner.
 *  Foo fooClone = Cloner.deepClone(foo);
 *
 *  </pre>
