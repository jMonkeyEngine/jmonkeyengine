/**
 *  Indicates an object that wishes to more actively participate in the
 *  two-part deep copying process provided by the Cloner.  Objects implementing
 *  this interface can access the already cloned object graph to resolve
 *  their local dependencies in a way that will be equivalent to the
 *  original object graph.  In other words, if two objects in the graph
 *  share the same target reference then the cloned version will share
 *  the cloned reference. 
 *  
 *  <p>For example, if an object wishes to deep clone one of its fields
 *  then it will call cloner.clone(object) instead of object.clone().
 *  The cloner will keep track of any clones already created for 'object'
 *  and return that instead of a new clone.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Cloning of a JmeCloneable object is done in two parts.  First,
 *  the standard Java clone() method is called to create a shallow clone
 *  of the object.  Second, the cloner will call the cloneFields() method
 *  to let the object deep clone any of its fields that should be cloned.</p>
 *
 *  <p>This two part process is necessary to facilitate circular references.
 *  When an object calls cloner.clone() during its cloneFields() method, it
 *  may get only a shallow copy that will be filled in later.</p>

     *  Performs a regular shallow clone of the object.  Some fields
     *  may also be cloned but generally only if they will never be
     *  shared with other objects.  (For example, local Vector3fs and so on.)
     *
     *  <p>This method is separate from the regular clone() method
     *  so that objects might still maintain their own regular java clone()
     *  semantics (perhaps even using Cloner for those methods).  However,
     *  because Java's clone() has specific features in the sense of Object's
     *  clone() implementation, it's usually best to have some path for
     *  subclasses to bypass the public clone() method that might be cloning
     *  fields and instead get at the superclass protected clone() methods.
     *  For example, through super.jmeClone() or another protected clone
     *  method that some base class eventually calls super.clone() in.</p>
