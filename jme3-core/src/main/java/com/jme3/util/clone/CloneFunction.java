/**
 *  Provides custom cloning for a particular object type.  Once

 *  It will first call cloneObject() to shallow clone the object and then call
 *  cloneFields()  to deep clone the object's values.
 *
 *  <p>This two step process is important because this is what allows
 *  circular references in the cloned object graph.</p>
