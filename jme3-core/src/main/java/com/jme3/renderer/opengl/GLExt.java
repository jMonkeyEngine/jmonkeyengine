     * <p>{@code usage} is a hint to the GL implementation as to how a buffer object's data store will be accessed. This enables the GL implementation to make

     * <li><em>DYNAMIC</em> - The data store contents will be modified repeatedly and used many times.</li>

     * <p>
     * <p>The nature of access may be one of these:</p>
     * <p>
     * <ul>
     * <li><em>DRAW</em> - The data store contents are modified by the application, and used as the source for GL drawing and image specification commands.</li>
     * <li><em>READ</em> - The data store contents are modified by reading data from the GL, and used to return that data when queried by the application.</li>
     * <li><em>COPY</em> - The data store contents are modified by reading data from the GL, and used as the source for GL drawing and image specification commands.</li>
