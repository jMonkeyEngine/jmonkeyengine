 * <code>WrappedIndexBuffer</code> converts vertex indices from a non list based
 * mesh mode such as {@link Mode#TriangleStrip} or {@link Mode#LineLoop}
 * into a list based mode such as {@link Mode#Triangles} or {@link Mode#Lines}.
 * As it is often more convenient to read vertex data in list format

 * convoluting classes used to process mesh data from an external source.
