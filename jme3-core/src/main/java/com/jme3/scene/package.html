The <code>com.jme3.input</code> package contains the scene graph implementation
in jMonkeyEngine.

<p>
    The scene graph is the most important package in jME, as it is the API
    used to manage scene elements so that they can be rendered. 
    The {@link com.jme3.scene.Spatial} class provides a common base class
    for all scene graph elements. The {@link com.jme3.scene.Node} class provides
    the "branches" in the graph, used to organize elements in a tree
    hierarchy. The {@link com.jme3.scene.Geometry} is the leaf class that
    will contain a {@link com.jme3.scene.Mesh} object (geometry data
    such as vertex positions, normals, etc.) and a {@link com.jme3.material.Material}
    object containing information on how the geometry should be shaded.
