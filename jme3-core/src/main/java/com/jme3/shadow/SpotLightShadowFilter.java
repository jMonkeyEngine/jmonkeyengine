 * This Filter does basically the same as a SpotLightShadowRenderer except it
 * renders the post shadow pass as a fullscreen quad pass instead of a geometry
 * pass. It's mostly faster than PssmShadowRenderer as long as you have more
 * than a about ten shadow receiving objects. The expense is the draw back that
 * the shadow Receive mode set on spatial is ignored. So basically all and only
 * objects that render depth in the scene receive shadows. See this post for
 * more details
 * http://jmonkeyengine.org/groups/general-2/forum/topic/silly-question-about-shadow-rendering/#post-191599
 *
 * API is basically the same as the PssmShadowRenderer;
