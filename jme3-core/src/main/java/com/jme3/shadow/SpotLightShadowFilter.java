/**
 * This Filter does basically the same as a SpotLightShadowRenderer except it
 * renders the post shadow pass as a fullscreen quad pass instead of a geometry
 * pass. It's mostly faster than PssmShadowRenderer as long as you have more
 * than about ten shadow receiving objects. The expense is the drawback that
 * the shadow Receive mode set on spatial is ignored. So basically all and only
 * objects that render depth in the scene receive shadows.
 *
 * API is basically the same as the PssmShadowRenderer.
