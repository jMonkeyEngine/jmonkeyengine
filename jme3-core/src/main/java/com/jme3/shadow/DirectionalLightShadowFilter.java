/**
 * This Filter does basically the same as a DirectionalLightShadowRenderer
 * except it renders the post shadow pass as a fullscreen quad pass instead of a
 * geometry pass. It's mostly faster than PssmShadowRenderer as long as you have
 * more than about ten shadow receiving objects. The expense is the drawback
 * that the shadow Receive mode set on spatial is ignored. So basically all and
 * only objects that render depth in the scene receive shadows.
 *
 * API is basically the same as the PssmShadowRenderer.
