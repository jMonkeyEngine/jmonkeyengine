 * This Filter does basically the same as a DirectionalLightShadowRenderer

 * geometry pass. It's mostly faster than PssmShadowRenderer as long as you have
 * more than a about ten shadow receiving objects. The expense is the draw back
 * that the shadow Receive mode set on spatial is ignored. So basically all and
 * only objects that render depth in the scene receive shadows. See this post
 * for more details
 * http://jmonkeyengine.org/groups/general-2/forum/topic/silly-question-about-shadow-rendering/#post-191599
 *
 * API is basically the same as the PssmShadowRenderer;
