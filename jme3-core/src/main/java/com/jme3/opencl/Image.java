/**
 * Wrapper for an OpenCL image.
 * <br>
 * An image object is similar to a {@link Buffer}, but with a specific element
 * format and buffer structure.
 * <br>
 * The image is specified by the {@link ImageDescriptor}, specifying 
 * the extend and dimension of the image, and {@link ImageFormat}, specifying
 * the type of each pixel.
 * <br>
 * An image is created from scratch using 
 * {@link Context#createImage(com.jme3.opencl.MemoryAccess, com.jme3.opencl.Image.ImageFormat, com.jme3.opencl.Image.ImageDescriptor) }
 * or from OpenGL by
 * {@link Context#bindImage(com.jme3.texture.Image, com.jme3.texture.Texture.Type, int, com.jme3.opencl.MemoryAccess) }
 * (and alternative versions).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Most methods take long arrays as input: {@code long[] origin} and {@code long[] region}.
 * Both are arrays of length 3.
 * <br>
 * <b>origin</b> defines the (x, y, z) offset in pixels in the 1D, 2D or 3D
 * image, the (x, y) offset and the image index in the 2D image array or the (x)
 * offset and the image index in the 1D image array. If image is a 2D image
 * object, origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image or 1D image buffer
 * object, origin[1] and origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image array
 * object, origin[2] must be 0. If image is a 1D image array object, origin[1]
 * describes the image index in the 1D image array. If image is a 2D image array
 * object, origin[2] describes the image index in the 2D image array.
 * <br>
 * <b>region</b> defines the (width, height, depth) in pixels of the 1D, 2D or
 * 3D rectangle, the (width, height) in pixels of the 2D rectangle and the
 * number of images of a 2D image array or the (width) in pixels of the 1D
 * rectangle and the number of images of a 1D image array. If image is a 2D
 * image object, region[2] must be 1. If image is a 1D image or 1D image buffer
 * object, region[1] and region[2] must be 1. If image is a 1D image array
 * object, region[2] must be 1. The values in region cannot be 0.
