/**
 * Implementing the <code>CloneableSmartAsset</code> interface allows use

 * <p>
 * Smart asset management requires cooperation from the {@link AssetKey}. 
 * In particular, the AssetKey should return {@link WeakRefCloneAssetCache} in its 
 * {@link AssetKey#getCacheType()} method. Also smart assets MUST
 * create a clone of the asset and cannot return the same reference,
 * e.g. {@link AssetProcessor#createClone(java.lang.Object) createClone(someAsset)} <code>!= someAsset</code>.
 * <p>
 * If the {@link AssetManager#loadAsset(com.jme3.asset.AssetKey) } method
 * is called twice with the same asset key (equals() wise, not necessarily reference wise)
 * then both assets will have the same asset key set (reference wise) via
 * {@link AssetKey#AssetKey() }, then this asset key
 * is used to track all instances of that asset. Once all clones of the asset 
 * are garbage collected, the shared asset key becomes unreachable and at that 
 * point it is removed from the smart asset cache.
