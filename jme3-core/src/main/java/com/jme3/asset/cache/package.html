<code>com.jme3.asset.cache</code> contains the {@link com.jme3.asset.cache.AssetCache}
interface as well as its implementations.<br>

<p>
    
<h3>AssetCaches</h3>
The asset cache implementations are used by {@link com.jme3.asset.AssetManager}
to cache loaded assets for faster access if they are requested again.
<p>
Assets in jME3 are cached in such a way that if there are no instances of
that asset anymore in memory, then jME3 is likely to reclaim them. 
Some asset types must be cloned prior to being used, for example, 3D models 
cannot be stored in the cache as-is, because the user is likely to modify them
after loading them. To handle this, a copy of the asset is stored in the 
cache instead. The asset cache that implements these rules is the 
{@link com.jme3.asset.cache.WeakRefCloneAssetCache} and it is used
for caching most asset types.
