/**
 * A LightProbe is not exactly a light. It holds environment map information used for Image Based Lighting.
 * This is used for indirect lighting in the Physically Based Rendering pipeline.
 * 
 * A light probe has a position in world space. This is the position from where the Environment Map are rendered.
 * There are two environment data structure  held by the LightProbe :
 * - The irradiance spherical harmonics factors (used for indirect diffuse lighting in the PBR pipeline).
 * - The prefiltered environment map (used for indirect specular lighting and reflection in the PBE pipeline).
 * Note that when instantiating the LightProbe, both of those structures are null.
 * To compute them see {@link LightProbeFactory#makeProbe(com.jme3.environment.EnvironmentCamera, com.jme3.scene.Node)}
 * and {@link EnvironmentCamera}.
 * 
 * The light probe has an area of effect that is a bounding volume centered on its position. (for now only Bounding spheres are supported).
 * 
 * A LightProbe will only be taken into account when it's marked as ready. 
 * A light probe is ready when it has valid environment map data set.
 * Note that you should never call setReady yourself.
