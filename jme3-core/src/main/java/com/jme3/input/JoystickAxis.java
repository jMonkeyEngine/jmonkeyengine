    // Axis          | XBox  | Non-Xbox (generally) (includes actual Sony PS4 controllers)
    // --------------+-------+---------------
    // left trigger  | z     | rx   (also button 6)

    // left stick y  | y     | y
    // right stick x | rx    | z
    // right stick y | ry    | rz
    //
    // The issue is that in all cases I've seen, the XBox controllers will
    // use the name "xbox" somewhere in their name.  The Non-XBox controllers
    // never mention anything uniform... even the PS4 controller only calls
    // itself "Wireless Controller".  In that light, it seems easier to make
    // the default the ugly case and the "XBox" way the exception because it
    // can more easily be identified.
