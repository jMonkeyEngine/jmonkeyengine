/**
 * Terrain can be one or many meshes comprising of a, probably large, piece of land.
 * Terrain is Y-up in the grid axis, meaning gravity acts in the -Y direction.
 * Level of Detail (LOD) is supported and expected as terrains can get very large. LOD can
 * also be disabled if you so desire, however some terrain implementations can choose to ignore
 * useLOD(boolean).
 * Terrain implementations should extend Node, or at least Spatial.
