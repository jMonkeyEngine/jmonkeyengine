 * FractalSum is the simplest form of fractal functions summing up a few octaves
 * of the noise value with an ever decreasing roughness (0 to 1) amplitude
 * 
 * lacunarity = 2.0f is the classical octave distance
 * 
 * Note: though noise basis functions are generally designed to return value
 * between -1..1, there sum can easily be made to extend out of this range. To
 * handle this is up to the user.
