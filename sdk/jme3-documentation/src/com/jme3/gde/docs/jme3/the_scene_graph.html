<h1><a>The Scene Graph and Other jME3 Terminology</a></h1>
<div>

<p>

Before you start making games, make sure you understand general <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/terminology.html">3D Gaming terminology</a>.
</p>

<p>
Second, if you are a beginner, we recommend our <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/scenegraph_for_dummies.html">Scene Graph for Dummies</a> presentation for a visual introduction to the concept of a scene graph. 
</p>

<h2><a>Coordinate System</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

<img src="nbdocs:/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/intermediate/coordinate-system.png">
</p>

<p>
The jMonkeyEngine uses a right-handed coordinate system, just as OpenGL does.
</p>

<p>
The coordinate system consists of:

</p>
<ul>
<li><div> The <em>origin</em>, a single central point in space.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> The origin point is always at coordinate zero, in Java: <code>new Vector3f(0,0,0)</code>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Three <em>coordinate axes</em> that are mutually perpendicular, and meet in the origin. </div>
<ul>
<li><div> The X axis starts left and goes right.</div>
</li>
<li><div> The Y axis starts below and goes up.</div>
</li>
<li><div> The Z axis starts away from you, and goes towards you.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Every point in 3D space is uniquely defined by its X,Y,Z coordinates. The three numeric coordinates express how many &quot;steps&quot; from each of the three axes a point is. The data type for all vectors in jME3 is <code>com.jme3.math.Vector3f</code>. All vectors are relative to the described coordinate system.  <br/>
Example: The point <code>new Vector3f(3,-5,1)</code> is 3 steps to the right, 5 steps down, and 1 towards you.
</p>

<p>
<p><div>The unit of meassurement (&quot;one step&quot;) in jME3 is the <strong>world unit</strong>, short: wu. Typically, 1 wu is considered to be one meter. As long as you are consistant throughout your game, 1 wu can be any distance you like.
</div></p>
</p>

<p>
For your orientation:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> The default camera&#039;s location is <code>Vector3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 10.0f)</code>.</div>
</li>
<li><div> The default camera is looking in the direction described by the (so called) negative Z unit vector <code>Vector3f(0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f)</code>. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This means the player&#039;s point of view is on the positive side of the Z axis, looking back, towards the origin, down the Z axis.
</p>

<h2><a>How to move yourself through the 3D scene</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

When you play a 3D game, you typically want to navigate the 3D scene. Note that by default, the mouse pointer is invisible, and the mouse is set up to control the camera rotation!
</p>

<p>
By default, jME3 uses the following common navigation inputs

</p>
<div><table>
	<tr>
		<th> Game Inputs </th><th> Camera Motion </th><th> Player POV </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Press the W and S keys</td><td>move the camera forward, and backward</td><td>you walk back and forth</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Press the A and D keys</td><td>move the camera left and right</td><td>you step left or right</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Press the Q and Y keys</td><td>move the camera up and down</td><td>you fly up and down</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Move the mouse left-right</td><td>rotate the camera left/right</td><td>you look left or right</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Move the mouse forwards-backwards</td><td>rotate up/down</td><td>you look at the sky or your feet</td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<!-- EDIT4 TABLE [2265-2712] -->
<p>

These default settings are called &quot;WASD keys&quot; and &quot;Mouse Look&quot;. You can customize <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/input_handling.html">input handling</a> for your game. Sorry, but these settings work best on a QWERTY/QWERTZ keyboard.

<h2><a>Scene Graph and RootNode</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

The <em>scene graph</em> represents your 3D world. Objects in the jME3 scene graph are called <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/spatial.html">Spatial</a>s. Everything attached to the parent <em>rootNode</em> is part of your scene. Your game inherits the <code>rootNode</code> object from the <code>SimpleApplication</code> class. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="nbdocs:/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/intermediate/scene-graph.png">

</p>
<ul>
<li><div> <em>Attaching</em> a Spatial to the rootNode (or its child nodes) adds it to the scene; </div>
</li>
<li><div> <em>Detaching</em> a Spatial from the rootNode (or its child nodes) removes it from the scene.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

All objects in the scene graph are in a parent-child relationship. When you transform (move, rotate, scale) one parent, all its children follow.
</p>

<p>
<p><div>The scene graph only manages the parent-child relationship of spatials. The actual location, rotation, or scale of an object is stored inside each Spatial. 
</div></p>

</p>

</div>

<h2><a>Spatials: Node vs Geometry</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A Spatial can be transformed (in other words, it has a location, a rotation, and a scale). A Spatial can be loaded and saved as a .3jo file. There are two types of Spatials, <em>Nodes</em> and <em>Geometries</em>:

</p>
<div><table>
	<tr>
		<td>  </td><th> Spatial </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Purpose: </th><td> A Spatial is an abstract data structure that stores transformations (translation, rotation, scale). </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>  </td><th> Geometry </th><th> Node </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Visibility: </th><td> A visible 3-D object. </td><td> An invisible &quot;handle&quot; for a group of objects. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Purpose: </th><td> A Geometry represents the &quot;look&quot; of an object: Shape, color, texture, opacity/transparency. </td><td> A Node groups Geometries and other Nodes together: You transform a Node to affect all attached Nodes (parent-child relationship). </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Content: </th><td> Transformations, mesh, material. </td><td> Transformations. No mesh, no material. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Examples: </th><td> A box, a sphere, player, a building, a piece of terrain, a vehicle, missiles, NPCs, etc??? </td><td> The rootNode, the guiNode, an audioNode, a custom grouping node for a vehicle plus its passengers, etc. </td>
	</tr>
