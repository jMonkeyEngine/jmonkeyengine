<div>

<p>

A physics simulation is used in games and applications where objects are exposed to physical forces: Think of games like pool billiard and car racing simulators. Massive objects are pulled by gravity, forces cause objects to gain momentum, friction slows them down, solid objects collide and bounce off one another, etc. Action and Adventure games also make use of physics to implement solid obstacles, falling, and jumping.

<h2><a>Technical Overview</a></h2>
<div>

<p>
jME3 has a complete, slightly adapted but fully wrapped Bullet <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> that uses normal jME math objects (Vector3f, Quaternion etc) as input/output data. All normal bullet objects like RigidBodies, Constraints (called &quot;Joints&quot; in jME3) and the various collision shapes are available, all mesh formats can be converted from jME to bullet.
</p>

<p>
The PhysicsSpace object is the central object in bullet and all objects have to be added to it so they are physics-enabled. You can create multiple physics spaces as well to have multiple independent physics simulations or to run simulations in the background that you step at a different pace. You can also create a Bullet PhysicsSpace in jME3 with a <code>com.jme3.bullet.BulletAppState</code> which runs a PhysicsSpace along the update loop, which is the easiest way to instantiate a physics space. It can be run in a mode where it runs in parallel to rendering, yet syncs to the update loop so you can apply physics changes safely during the update() calls of Controls and SimpleApplication.
</p>

<p>
The base bullet objects are also available as simple to use controls that can be attached to spatials to directly control these by physics forces and influences. The RigidBodyControl for example includes a simple constructor that automatically creates a hull collision shape or a mesh collision shape based on the given input mass and the mesh of the spatial it is attached to. This makes enabling physics on a Geometry as simple as &quot;spatial.addControl(new RigidBodyControl(1));&quot;
</p>

<p>
Due to some differences in how bullet and jME handle the scene and other objects relations there is some things to remember about the controls implementation:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> The collision shape is not automatically updated when the spatial mesh changes</div>
<ul>
<li><div> You can update it by reattaching the control or by using the CollisionShapeFactory yourself.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> In bullet the scale parameter is on the collision shape (which equals the mesh in jME3) and not on the RigidBody so you cannot scale a collision shape without scaling any other RigidBody with reference of it</div>
<ul>
<li><div> Note that you should share collision shapes in general and that j3o files loaded from file do that as well when instantiated twice so this is something to consider.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> <strong>Physics objects remain in the physics space when their spatials are detached from the scene graph!</strong></div>
<ul>
<li><div> Use PhysicsSpace.remove(physicsObject) or simply physicsControl.setEnabled(false); to remove them from the PhysicsSpace</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> If you apply forces to the physics object in an update() call they might not get applied because internally bullet still runs at 60fps while your app might run at 120.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> You can use the PhysicsTickListener interface and register with the physics space and use the preTick() method to be sure that you actually apply the force in the right moment.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Reading values from the physics objects in the update loop should always yield correct values but they might not change over several fames due to the same reason.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Reading or writing from the physics objects during the render phase is not recommended as this is when the physics space is stepped and would cause data corruption. This is why the debug display does not work properly in a threaded BulletAppState</div>
</li>
<li><div> Bullet always uses world coordinates, there is no such concept as nodes so the object will be moved into a world location with no regard to its parent spatial.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> You can configure this behavior using the setApplyPhysicsLocal() method on physics controls but remember the physics space still runs in world coordinates so you can visually detach things that will actually still collide in the physics space.</div>
</li>
<li><div> To use the local applying to simulate e.g. the internal physics system of a train passing by, simply create another BulletAppState and add all models with physics controls in local mode to a node. When you move the node the physics will happen all the same but the objects will move along with the node.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

When you use this physics simulation, values correspond to the following units:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> 1 length unit (1.0f) equals 1 meter, </div>
</li>
<li><div> 1 weight unit (1.0f) equals 1 kilogram,</div>
</li>
<li><div> most torque and rotation values are expressed in radians.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Bullet physics runs internally at 60fps by default. This rate is not dependent on the actual framerate and it does not lock the framerate at 60fps. Instead, when the actual fps is higher than the physics framerate the system will display interpolated positions for the physics objects. When the framerate is lower than the physics framerate, the physics space will be stepped multiple times per frame to make up for the missing calculations. 
</p>

<p>
Internally, the updating and syncing of the actual physics objects in the BulletAppState happens in the following way:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> collision callbacks (<code>BulletAppState.update()</code>)</div>
</li>
<li><div> user update (<code>simpleUpdate</code> in main loop, <code>update()</code> in Controls and AppStates)</div>
</li>
<li><div> physics to scenegraph syncing and applying (<code>updateLogicalState()</code>)</div>
</li>
<li><div> stepping physics (before or in parallel to <code>Application.render()</code>)</div>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a>Physics Application</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A short overview of how to write a jME application with Physics capabilities:
</p>

<p>
Do the following once per application to gain access to the <code>physicsSpace</code> object:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Make your application extend <code>com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication</code>.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create a BulletAppState field: <pre>private BulletAppState bulletAppState;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Initialize your bulletAppState and attach it to the state manager: <pre>public void simpleInitApp&#40;&#41; &#123;
    bulletAppState = new BulletAppState&#40;&#41;;
    stateManager.attach&#40;bulletAppState&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

<p><div>In your application, you can always access the <code>BulletAppState</code> via the ApplicationStateManager: 
</p>
<pre>BulletAppState bas = app.getStateManager&#40;&#41;.getState&#40;BulletAppState.class&#41;;</pre>

<p>

</div></p>
</p>

<p>
For each Spatial that you want to be physical:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Create a CollisionShape.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create the PhysicsControl from the CollisionShape and a mass value.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add the PhysicsControl to its Spatial.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add the PhysicsControl to the PhysicsSpace.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Attach the Spatial to the rootNode (as usual).</div>
</li>
<li><div> (Optional) Implement the <code>PhysicsCollisionListener</code> interface to respond to <code>PhysicsCollisionEvent</code>s.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Let&#039;s look at the details: 
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT4 SECTION "Physics Application" [6541-7742] -->
<h2><a>Create a CollisionShape</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A CollisionShape is a simplified shape for which physics are easier to calculate than for the true shape of the model. This simplication approach speeds up the simulation greatly.
</p>

<p>
Before you can create a Physics Control, you must create a CollisionShape from the <code>com.jme3.bullet.collision.shapes</code> package. (Read the tip under &quot;PhysicsControls Code Samples&quot; how to use default CollisionShapes for Boxes and Spheres.)

<h3><a>Physics Control Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The most commonly used physics control is RigidBodyControl.  The RigidBodyControl constructor takes up to two parameters:  a collision shape and a mass (a float in kilograms).  The mass parameter also determines whether the object is dynamic (movable) or static (fixed). For a static object such as a floor or wall, specify zero mass. 
</p>
<pre>RigidBodyControl myThing_phys = 
    new RigidBodyControl&#40; myThing_shape , 123.0f &#41;; // dynamic</pre>
<pre>RigidBodyControl myDungeon_phys = 
    new RigidBodyControl&#40; myDungeon_shape , 0.0f &#41;; // static </pre>

<p>
<p><div>If you give your floor a non-zero mass, it will fall out of the scene!
</div></p>
</p>

<p>
The following creates a box Geometry with the correct default BoxCollisionShape:
</p>
<pre>Box b = new Box&#40;1,1,1&#41;;
Geometry box_geo = new Geometry&#40;&quot;Box&quot;, b&#41;;
box_geo.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40; 1.0f &#41;&#41;; // explicit non-zero mass, implicit BoxCollisionShape</pre>

<p>

The following creates a MeshCollisionShape for a whole loaded (static) scene:

</p>
<pre>...
gameLevel.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40;0.0f&#41;&#41;; // explicit zero mass, implicit MeshCollisionShape</pre>

<p>
<p><div>Spheres and Boxes automatically fall back on the correct default CollisionShape if you do not specify a CollisionShape in the RigidBodyControl constructor. Complex static objects can fall back on MeshCollisionShapes, unless it is a Node, in which case it will become a CompoundCollisionShape containing a MeshCollisionShape

<h2><a>Changing the Scale of a PhysicsControl</a></h2>
<div>

<p>
To change the scale of a PhysicsControl you must change the scale of the collisionshape which belongs to it.
</p>

<p>
MeshCollisionShapes can have a scale correctly set, but it only works when being constructed on a geometry (not a node). CompoundCollisionShapes cannot be scaled at this time(the type obtained when creating a CollisionShape from a Node i.e using imported models).
</p>

<p>
When you import a model from blender, it often comes as a Node (even if it only contains 1 mesh), which is by de-facto automatically converted to a CompoundCollisionShape. So when you try to scale this it won&#039;t work! Below illustrates an example, of how to scale an imported model:
</p>
<pre>// Doesn't scale
// This modified version contains Node -&gt; Geometry (name = &quot;MonkeyHeadGeom&quot;)
Spatial model = assetManager.loadModel&#40;&quot;Models/MonkeyHead.j3o&quot;&#41;; model.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40;0&#41;&#41;;
// Won't work as this is now a CompoundCollisionShape containing a MeshCollisionShape
model.getControl&#40;RigidBodyControl.class&#41;.getCollisionShape&#40;&#41;.setScale&#40;new Vector3f&#40;2, 2, 2&#41;&#41;; 
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;model&#41;;
&nbsp;
// Works fine
Spatial model = assetManager.loadModel&#40;&quot;Models/MonkeyHead.j3o&quot;&#41;; // Same Model
 // IMPORTANT : You must navigate to the Geometry for this to work
Geometry geom = &#40;&#40;Geometry&#41; &#40;&#40;Node&#41; model&#41;.getChild&#40;&quot;MonkeyHeadGeom&quot;&#41;&#41;;
geom.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40;0&#41;&#41;;
// Works great (scaling of a MeshCollisionShape)	
geom.getControl&#40;RigidBodyControl.class&#41;.getCollisionShape&#40;&#41;.setScale&#40;new Vector3f&#40;2, 2, 2&#41;&#41;;

<p><div>It is technically possible to position PhysicsControls using setLocalTranslation(), e.g. to place them in their start position in the scene.

<p><div> You can <code>setApplyPhysicsLocal(true)</code> for an object to make it move relatively to its local physics space. You would do that if you need a physics space that moves with a node (e.g. a spaceship with artificial gravity surrounded by zero-g space).

<h2><a>Best Practices</a></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Multiple Objects Too Slow?</strong> Do not overuse PhysicsControls. Although PhysicsControls are put to ???sleep??? when they are not moving, creating a world solely out of dynamic physics objects will quickly bring you to the limits of your computer&#039;s capabilities. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Improve performance by replacing some physical Spatials with non-physical Spatials. Use the non-physical ones for non-solid things for which you do not need to detect collisions ??? foliage, plants, effects, ghosts, all remote or unreachable objects.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Complex Shape Too Slow?</strong> Breaking the level into manageable pieces helps the engine improve performance: The less CPU-intensive <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune"><param name="text" value="<html><u>broadphase</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object> filters out parts of the scene that are out of reach. It only calculates the collisions for objects that are actually close to the action. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> A huge static city or terrain model should never be loaded as one huge mesh. Divide the scene into multiple physics objects, with each its own CollisionShape. Choose the most simple CollisionShape possible; use mesh-accurate shapes only for the few cases where precision is more important than speed. For example, you can use the very fast <code>PlaneCollisionShape</code> for flat streets, floors and the outside edge of the scene, if you keep these pieces separate.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Eject?</strong> If you have physical nodes jittering wildy and being ejected &quot;for no apparent reason&quot;, it means you have created an impossible state ??? solid objects overlapping. This can happen when you position solid spatials too close to other solid spatials, e.g. when moving them with setLocalTranslation(). <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Use the debug mode to make CollisionShapes visible and verify that CollisionShapes do not overlap. <pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.enableDebug&#40;assetManager&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Buggy?</strong> If you get weird behaviour, such as physical nodes passing through one another, or getting stuck for no reason. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Look at the physics space accessors and change the acuracy and other parameters.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> <strong>Need more interactivity?</strong> You can actively <em>control</em> a physical game by triggering forces. You may also want to be able <em>respond</em> to collisions, e.g. by substracting health, awarding points, or by playing a sound. <br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> To specify how the game responds to collisions, you use <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/physics_listeners.html">Physics Listeners</a>.</div>
