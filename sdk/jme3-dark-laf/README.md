# DarkMonkey
Netbeans LAF and FAC combo - uses NimROD and Obsidian

This is a plug-in for for Netbeans 8+ (well, the version it was developed for is 8.0.2). We wanted a dark theme variant for the jMonkeyEngine 3.1 sdk, so we made one. Enjoy!

## Features
- Adds the DarkMonkey LaF to the Netbeans 8 environment under appearance - It's NimROD with a couple of tweaks. We've just adapted Nilo's wonderful project for the look we were going for.
- Adds the DarkMonkey FaC to the editor profile listing - It's Obsidian with some tweaks. DejaVu Sans Mono brings some sophistication to an otherwise courier world.
