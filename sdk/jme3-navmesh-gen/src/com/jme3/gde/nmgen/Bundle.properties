    Nav Mesh Generator - generates a triangle mesh to be used for navigation
OpenIDE-Module-Name=NavMeshGen
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Nav Mesh Generator
CTL_NavMeshTopComponent=Nav Mesh Editor
HINT_NavMeshTopComponent=Nav Mesh generator window
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=NavMeshGen
properties.nmgen=
properties.cellSize=The width and depth resolution used when sampling the source mesh
properties.cellHeight=The height resolution used when sampling the source mesh
properties.minTraversableHeight=Represents the minimum floor to ceiling height that will still allow the floor area to be considered walkable
properties.maxTraversableStep=Represents the maximum ledge height that is considered to still be walkable
properties.maxTraversableSlope=The maximum slope that is considered walkable. (Degrees)
properties.clipLedges=Indicates whether ledges should be marked as unwalkable
properties.traversableAreaBorderSize=Represents the closest any part of the navmesh can get to an obstruction in the source mesh
properties.smoothingThreshold=The amount of smoothing to be performed when generating the distance field
properties.useConservativeExpansion=Applies extra algorithms to regions to help prevent poorly formed regions from forming. Enabling this feature significantly increased processing cost.
properties.minUnconnectedRegionSize=The minimum region size for unconnected (island) regions. (Voxels) 
properties.mergeRegionSize=Any regions smaller than this size will, if possible, be merged with larger regions. (Voxels)
properties.maxEdgeLength=The maximum length of polygon edges that represent the border of the navmesh
properties.edgeMaxDeviation=The maximum distance the edge of the navmesh may deviate from the source geometry. Setting this lower will result in the navmesh edges following the geometry contour more accurately.
properties.maxVertsPerPoly=The maximum number of vertices per polygon. Higher values reduce performance, but result in better formed triangles. Diminishing returns for values higher than 6.
properties.contourSampleDistance=Sets the sampling distance. Higher values result in a navmesh which conforms more closely to the original geometry's surface at the cost of a higher final triangle count and higher processing cost
properties.contourMaxDeviation=The maximum distance the surface of the navmesh may deviate from the surface of the original geometry.
properties.timeout=Stops the calculation from running too long.
