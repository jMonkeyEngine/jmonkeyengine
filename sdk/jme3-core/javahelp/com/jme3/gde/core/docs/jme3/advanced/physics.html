<p>
Game Physics are used in applications that simulate mass/gravity, collisions, and friction. Think of pool billiard or car racing simulations.

<h2><a>Technical Overview</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

Bullet physics runs internally at 60fps by default. This rate is not dependent on the actual framerate and it does not lock the framerate at 60fps. Instead, when the actual fps is higher than the physics framerate the system will display interpolated positions for the physics objects. When the framerate is lower than the physics framerate the physics space will be stepped multiple times per frame to make up for the missing calculations.
</p>

<p>
A bullet physics space can be created with a BulletAppState. The updating and syncing of the actual physics objects happens in the following way:
</p>

<p>
A &quot;normal&quot; update loop with physics looks like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> collision callbacks (BulletAppState.update())</div>
</li>
<li><div> user update (simpleUpdate / update)</div>
</li>
<li><div> physics to scenegraph syncing/applying (updateLogicalState())</div>
</li>
<li><div> stepping physics (before / in parallel to Application.render())</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
When you use physics, 1 unit (1.0f) equals 1 meter, weight is expressed in kilograms, most torque and rotation values are expressed in radians.
</p>

<h2><a>Physics Application</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

A short overview of how to write a jME application with Physics capabilities:
</p>

<p>
Do the following once per application to gain access to the <code>physicsSpace</code> object:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Make you application extend <code>com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication</code>.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create a BulletAppState field: <pre>private BulletAppState bulletAppState;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Initialize your bulletAppState and attach it to the state manager: <pre>public void simpleInitApp&#40;&#41; &#123;
    bulletAppState = new BulletAppState&#40;&#41;;
    stateManager.attach&#40;bulletAppState&#41;;
    ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

You can also access the BulletAppState via the state manager:
</p>
<pre>stateManager.getState&#40;BulletAppState.class&#41;</pre>

<p>
For each Spatial that you want to be physical:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Create a CollisionShape.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Create a PhysicsControl by supplying the CollisionShape and mass.</div>
<ul>
<li><div> E.g. <code>com.jme3.bullet.control.RigidBodyControl</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><div> Add the PhysicsControl to the Spatial.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add the PhysicsControl to the physicsSpace object.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Attach the Spatial to the rootNode, as usual.</div>
</li>
<li><div> (Optional) Implement the <code>PhysicsCollisionListener</code> interface to respond to <code>PhysicsCollisionEvent</code>s if desired.</div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h3><a>Collision Shapes</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

A Collision Shape is a simplified shape for which physics are easier to calculate than for the true shape of the model. This simplication approach speeds up the simulation greatly.
</p>

<p>
Before you can create a Physics Control, you must create a Collision Shape from the <code>com.jme3.bullet.collision.shapes</code> package. (Read the tip under &quot;PhysicsControls Code Samples&quot; to learn how to use default CollisionShapes for Boxes and Spheres.)

</p>
<div><table>
	<tr>
		<th> Shape                     </th><th> Purpose </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> BoxCollisionShape         </td><td> Box shaped objects such as bricks, crates, simple obstacles. Does not roll. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> SphereCollisionShape      </td><td> Spherical objects such as balls. Can roll. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> CylinderCollisionShape    </td><td> Tube-shaped pillars, disc-shaped wheels. Can roll on one side. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> CapsuleCollisionShape     </td><td> A compound of a cylinder plus two spheres at the top and bottom. Rotated upright, this shape is optimal for CharacterControls: A cylinder-shaped body does not get stuck at corners and vertical obstacles; the rounded top and bottom do not get stuck on stair steps and ground obstacles. Is locked to stay upright, does not roll. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> CompoundCollisionShape    </td><td> A CompoundCollisionShape allows custom combinations of box/sphere/cylinder shapes to form another more complex shape. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> MeshCollisionShape        </td><td> A free-form mesh-accurate shape that wraps itself around a mesh. <br/>
<strong>Limitations:</strong> Only non-mesh collision shapes (sphere, box, cylinder, compound) can collide with mesh-accurate collision shapes. The Mesh Collision Shape only works for static obstacles, e.g. for a game level model. </td>

	<tr>
		<td> SimplexCollisionShape </td><td>A physical point, line, triangle, or quad Collision Shape, defined by one to four points.</td>

		<td> PlaneCollisionShape </td><td> A 2D plane that can be used as flat solid floor or wall. </td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<!-- EDIT1 TABLE [3692-5610] -->
<p>

<strong>Tip:</strong> Pick the right shape for the mesh for what you want to do: If you give a box a sphere collision shape, it will roll; if you give a ball a box collision shape, it will sit on a slope. Make collision shapes visible by adding the following line after the bulletAppState initialization: 
</p>
<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.enableDebug&#40;assetManager&#41;;</pre>

<p>
Let&#039;s look at examples of how to use the CollisionShape constructor:
</p>

</div>

<h3><a>CollisionShape Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

MeshCompoundShape and MeshCollisionShape are both mesh-accurate and are intended for immobile scene objects, such as terrains, buildings, or whole shooter levels. Limitation: Only collisions of non-mesh-accurate shapes (sphere, box, etc) shapes can be detected against mesh-accurate shapes.

</p>
<pre>CompoundCollisionShape myComplexShape =
    CollisionShapeFactory.createMeshShape&#40;&#40;Node&#41; myComplexGeometry &#41;;</pre>

<p>
An angular, non-mesh-accurate compound shape:
</p>
<pre>CompoundCollisionShape boxShape =
    CollisionShapeFactory.createBoxCompoundShape&#40;&#40;Node&#41; someBox&#41;;</pre>

<p>
SphereCollisionShape, BoxCollisionShape, CapsuleCollisionShape are also not mesh-accurate, but have better performance. The can be added to anything, and collisions between them and any other shape can be detected.
</p>
<pre>SphereCollisionShape sphereShape =
    new SphereCollisionShape&#40;1.0f&#41;;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>PhysicsControls</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

BulletPhysics are available in jME3 through Bullet Physics Controls from the com.jme3.bullet.control package. PhysicsControls are the recommended way to use physics in a jME3 application. PhysicsControls are flexible and can be added to any Spatial to make it act according to physical properties. These Control classes directly extend Bullet Physics Objects. 

</p>
<div><table>
	<tr>
		<th>Physics Control</th><th>Purpose</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RigidBodyControl</td><td>Use for physical objects in the scene, e.g. projectiles and obstacles – things that are freely affected by physical forces, be it by collision or falling.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CharacterControl</td><td>Use for characters (persons, animals) that stand upright, orthogonally to the X/Z plane. When directional forces are applied to a CharacterControl&#039;ed Spatial, it does not tip over (as a RigidBodyControl&#039;ed Spatial would), but it moves upright (as a walking character would).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>GhostControl</td><td>A GhostControl is a PhysicsControl that detects overlaps with other physical objects. A GhostControl is <em>non-solid</em> and moves with the Spatial it is attached to. Use this for game elements that do not have a visible solid Geometry: Aggro radius, motion detectors, photoelectric sensors, radioactive areas, life-draining ghosts, etc. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>VehicleControl <br/>
PhysicsVehicleWheel</td><td> Implements <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/vehicles.html">terrestric vehicle</a> behaviour.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RagDollControl</td><td> Implements <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/ragdoll.html">Ragdoll</a> behaviour.</td>
	</tr>
</table></div>
<!-- EDIT2 TABLE [7377-8399] -->
</div>

<h3><a>PhysicsControls Code Samples</a></h3>
<div>

<p>

The various Physics Control constructors expect a Collision Shape (here thingShape) and a mass (a float).
</p>
<pre>RigidBodyControl myControl=new RigidBodyControl&#40; thingShape , 1.0f &#41;;</pre>

<p>
To make the Physics Control visible in the scene, you must attach the Control to a Geometry (e.g. a model named myGeometry):
</p>
<pre>myGeometry.addControl&#40;myControl&#41;;</pre>

<p>
This code sample creates a physical Character:
</p>
<pre>// Load any model
Node model = &#40;Node&#41; assetManager.loadModel&#40;&quot;Models/myCharacterModel.mesh.xml&quot;&#41;;
rootNode.attachChild&#40;model&#41;;
// Create a appropriate physical shape for it
CapsuleCollisionShape capsuleShape = new CapsuleCollisionShape&#40;1.5f, 6f, 1&#41;;
CharacterControl character_phys = new CharacterControl&#40;capsuleShape, 0.01f&#41;;
// Attach physical properties to model and PhysicsSpace
model.addControl&#40;character_phys&#41;;
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;character_phys&#41;;</pre>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Spheres and Boxes can fall back to the correct default Collision Shape if you do not specify a Collision Shape in the RigidBodyControl constructor. For example, the following creates a box with the correct Box Collision Shape:
</p>
<pre>Box&#40;1,1,1&#41;;
myBox.addControl&#40;new RigidBodyControl&#40; 1.0f &#41;&#41;; // implicit BoxCollisionShape
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;myBox&#41;;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>Physics Space</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

The Physics Space is an object in BulletAppState that is like a rootNode for Physics Controls.
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> You can specify parameters such as gravity and accuracy.<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setGravity&#40;new Vector3f&#40;0f,-1f,0f&#41;&#41;;
bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.setAccuracy&#40;0.005f&#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add all PhysicsControls to the PhysicsSpace.<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.add&#40;myPhysicsControl&#41;; ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Add each PhysicsControl to a Spatial. <pre>myModel.addControl&#40;myPhysicsControl&#41;; ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> Attach the Spatial to the rootNode, as always. <pre>rootNode.attachChild&#40;myModel&#41;; ...</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

You remove physical objects from the scene like this: 

</p>
<pre>bulletAppState.getPhysicsSpace&#40;&#41;.remove&#40;myPhysicsControl&#41;;
myModel.removeFromParent&#40;&#41;;</pre>

</div>

<h2><a>Properties of Physical Objects</a></h2>

<h2><a>Best Practices</a></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div> You can control the game by triggering forces; or may want to respond to collisions, e.g. by substracting health points, or by playing a sound. To specify how the game responds to physics events, you use <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/physics_listeners.html">Physics Listeners</a>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> Do not overuse PhysicsControls. Although PhysicsControls are put to “sleep” when they are not moving, creating a world solely out of dynamic physics nodes will quickly bring you to the limits of your computer&#039;s capabilities.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> You can use normal non-physical Spatials in the same scene next to physical ones. Use the non-physical ones for non-solid things for which you do not want to detect collisions (ghost, foliage, plants, effects, …). This improves performance.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> If you get weird behaviour, such as physical nodes jittering wildy and being ejected &quot;for no apparent reason&quot;, it usually means you have created an impossible state. Verify that none of the collision shapes overlap. This can happen when you create physical nodes in positions that are too close to other nodes; or if you position a physical node using setLocalTranslation() and it touches another node&#039;s collision shape. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><div> For large static meshes like shooter levels or terrain it is best to divide the scene model into multiple physics objects, with each its own CollisionShape. A huge city level should not be one huge mesh (model) of pavement and streets and buildings. Instead, you make individual models for buildings, for pieces of pavement, for pieces of streets, etc. Position them next to one another to form the whole city, and give each piece its own optimal CollisionShape. E.g. streets can use a fast PlaneCollisionShape if you keep them separate for buildings. Breaking the level into manageable pieces helps the engine improve performance: The less CPU-intensive <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"><param name="content" value="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune"><param name="text" value="<html><u>broadphase</u></html>"><param name="textColor" value="blue"></object> can now filter out parts of the scene that are behind you or out of reach, and it only calculates the details of collisions for parts that are actually close to the action.</div>
