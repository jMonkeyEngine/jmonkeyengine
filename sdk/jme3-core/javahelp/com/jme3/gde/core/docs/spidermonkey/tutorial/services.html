class="level3"><p> Creating services is really easy - you just have to implement the Service interface. <strong>Make sure you don&#039;t do anything time consuming</strong> since the developer may not be expecting it. Services can choose to support Server, Client, or both. To implement this, use the appropriate constructors:</p><pre>public class MyExampleService implements Service &#123;
   public MyExampleService&#40;Server server&#41; &#123;
      // By adding the constructor with the Server as argument, this service
      //  now supports servers.
   &#125;
&nbsp;
   public MyExampleService&#40;Client client&#41; &#123;
      // Same goes for client. I could just leave this constructor out, and
      //  SpiderMonkey would determine this service does not support client mode.
   &#125;
&#125;</pre></div><h3><a

class="level3"><p> The Server and Client class both have a method called getService(). It retrieves a service based on class name, and instantiates it if necessary. From there you can use the service.</p><p> The Service system is not a terribly powerful system, neither does it do safety checks and service management - it just provides a way to commonly manage extensions.</p><p> That&#039;s it!
