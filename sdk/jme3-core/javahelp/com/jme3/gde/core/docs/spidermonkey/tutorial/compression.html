title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>! See <a
href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/networking.html">networking</a> for current documentation.</div></p> Now this is going to be a real simply tutorial but still I wanted this in a separate article. Why you may ask? Simply because it&#039;s a feature that requires some explanation, since it has some caveats that I&#039;ll discuss. Also, I&#039;ll cover writing your own compression message.</p><p> First off - there are two compression types in SpiderMonkey, they are GZip and Zip. Could&#039;ve added more, but didn&#039;t want to have a dependency for just a compression method. Both are used by wrapping your message in the appropriate compression message:</p><pre>MyMessage msg = new MyMessage&#40;&#41;;
client.send&#40;new GZIPCompressedMessage&#40;msg&#41;&#41;;
// or
client.send&#40;new ZIPCompressedMessage&#40;msg&#41;&#41;;</pre><p> Really simple, but ZIP requires some explanation. The ZIPCompressedMessage class also has two extra methods; setLevel(int) and getLevel(). These methods are for setting the compression level, where 1 is best compression but slowest, and where 9 is weakest compression but fastest. Please note that 9 is <strong>not</strong> the so called &#039;store&#039; ZIP method, which simply stores file in the ZIP, instead of compressing it. This &#039;store&#039; feature is not in SpiderMonkey since otherwise it would not have been called compression.</p></div><h3><a
name="writing_your_own">Writing your own</a></h3><div
class="level3"><p> Now of course I&#039;d love to see more compression methods in SpiderMonkey, so I&#039;ll discuss how to write your own. Let&#039;s just take GZIPCompressedMessage as example, since that one is the most straightforward. What I&#039;ve done, is I&#039;ve just created a GZIPCompressedMessage which extends CompressedMessage. It does not contain any extra messages, so the GZIPCompressedMessage class is practically &#039;empty&#039;. The magic happens at the serializer, which is called the GZIPSerializer (you can read about writing your own serializer <a
href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/spidermonkey/tutorial/serializing.html">here</a>). Then I just registered the GZIPSerializer to GZIPCompressedMessage and presto - you&#039;re done. Don&#039;t forget that in the Serializer you need to use writeClassAndObject first and then compress that data, and for read you&#039;d need to use readClassAndObject after you&#039;ve uncompressed (inflated) the message. For this to be clear, it may be useful to read <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/jmonkeyengine/source/browse/trunk/engine/src/networking/com/jme3/network/serializing/serializers/GZIPSerializer.java">the GZIPSerializer class</a>.</p><p> That&#039;s that! Next tutorial we&#039;re going to discuss how to use the Service system.</p></div>
