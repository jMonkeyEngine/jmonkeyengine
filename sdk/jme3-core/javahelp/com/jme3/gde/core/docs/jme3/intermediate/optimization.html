<h2><a>Maintain low Geometry count</a></h2>
<div>

<p>
The more Geometry objects are added to the scene, the harder it gets to handle them in a speedy fashion.
The reason for this is that a render command must be done for every object, potentially creating a bottleneck between the CPU and the graphics card.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Possible optimization techniques</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Use GeometryBatchFactory.optimize(node) to merge the meshes of the geometries contained in the given node into fewer batches, each based on common Materials used. <br/>
You can optimize nodes using the SceneComposer in the <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym> as well: Right-click a node and select &quot;Optimize Geometry&quot;.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Side-effects</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> Using GeometryBatchFactory merges individual Geometries into a single mesh. Thereby it becomes hard to apply specific Materials or to remove a single Geometry. Therefore it should be used for static Geometry only that does not require frequent changes or individual materials/texturing. </div>
</li>
<li><div> Using a <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/texture_atlas.html">Texture Atlas</a> provides limited individual texturing of batched geometries.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a>Avoid creating new objects</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

When you use math operations like <code>vectorA.mult(vectorB);</code>, they create new objects for the result. These objects have to be garbage collected when you don&#039;t use them anymore. 
</p>

<p>
Check your math operations for opportunities to use the <em>local</em> version of the math operations, e.g. <code>vectorA.multLocal(vectorB)</code>. Local methods store the result in vectorA and do not create a new object. Use local methods if you do not need to keep the previous vectorA.
</p>

<h2><a>Avoid large objects in physics</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

To offload much computation to the less CPU intense physics broadphase collision check, avoid having large meshes that cover e.g. the whole map of your level. Instead, separate the collision shapes into multiple smaller chunks. Obviously, don&#039;t exaggerate the chunking, because having excessive amounts of physics objects similarly cause performance problems.
</p>

<h2><a>Check the Statistics</a></h2>
<div>

<p>

SimpleApplication displays a HUD with statistics. Use <code>app.setDisplayStatView(true);</code> to activate it, and false to deactivate it. 
The StatsView counts Objects,Uniforms,Triangles,Vertices are in the scene, and it counts how many FrameBuffers, Textures, or Shaders:
</p>
<ul>
<li><div> ??? were switched in the last frame (S)</div>
</li>
<li><div> ??? were used during the last frame (F)</div>
</li>
<li><div> ??? exist in OpenGL memory (M)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

For example, <code>Textures (M)</code> tells you how many textures are currently in OpenGL memory.
</p>

<p>
Generally jME3 is well optimized and optimizes these things correctly. Read <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/advanced/statsview.html">statsview</a> to learn the details about how to interpret the statistics, how to tell whether your values are off, or whether they point out a problem.
