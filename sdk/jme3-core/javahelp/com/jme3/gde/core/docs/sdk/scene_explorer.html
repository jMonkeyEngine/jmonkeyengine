<h2><a>About the SceneExplorer window</a></h2>
<div>

<p>
The SceneExplorer gives you a structural overview of the currently edited scene and is active among all plugins
</p>

<p>
Most plugins will deliver their own UI elements to modify the scene so the SceneExplorer is more of a global tool. The simple SceneComposer however heavily relies on its functions as other plugins might too in the future.
