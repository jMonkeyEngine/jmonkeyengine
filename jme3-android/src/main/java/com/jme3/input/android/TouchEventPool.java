 * TouchEventPool provides a RingBuffer of jME TouchEvents to help with garbage
 * collection on Android.  Each TouchEvent is stored in the RingBuffer and is 
 * reused if the TouchEvent has been consumed.
 * 
 * If a TouchEvent has not been consumed, it is placed back into the pool at the 
 * end for later use.  If a TouchEvent has been consumed, it is reused to avoid
 * creating lots of little objects.
 * 
 * If the pool is full of unconsumed events, then a new event is created and provided.
