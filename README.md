Note: The master branch on GitHub is a development version of the engine and is NOT MEANT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION.

### Technology Stack

 - windowed, multi-platform IDE derived from NetBeans
 - libraries for GUI, networking, physics, SFX, terrain, importing assets, etc.
 - platform-neutral core library for scene graph, animation, rendering, math, etc.
 - LWJGL v2/v3 (to access GLFW, OpenAL, OpenGL, and OpenVR) or Android or iOS

### How to Build the Engine from Source

1. Install a Java Development Kit (JDK),
   if you don't already have one.
2. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
   (In other words, set it to the path of a directory/folder
   containing a "bin" that contains a Java executable.
   That path might look something like
   "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.3.7-hotspot"
   or "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/" or
   "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home" .)
  + using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
  + using Fish: `set -g JAVA_HOME "` *path to installation* `"`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
  + using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
3. Download and extract the engine source code from GitHub:
  + using Git:
    + `git clone https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine.git`
    + `cd jmonkeyengine`
    + `git checkout -b latest v3.7.0-stable` (unless you plan to do development)
  + using a web browser:
    + browse to [the latest release](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/latest)
    + follow the "Source code (zip)" link at the bottom of the page
    + save the ZIP file
    + extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
    + `cd` to the extracted directory/folder
4. Run the Gradle wrapper:
  + using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
fresh JARs will be found in "*/build/libs".

You can install the JARs to your local Maven repository:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew install`

You can run the "jme3-examples" app:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew run`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew run`

You can restore the project to a pristine state:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew clean`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew clean`
