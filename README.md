jMonkeyEngine 
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine)

jMonkeyEngine is a 3D game engine for adventurous Java developers. Itâ€™s open source, cross platform and cutting edge. And it is all beautifully documented. The 3.0 branch is the latest stable version of the jMonkeyEngine 3 SDK, a complete game development suite. We'll be frequently submitting stable 3.0.x updates until the major 3.1 version arrives.

The engine is used by several commercial game studios and computer-science courses. Here's a taste:
