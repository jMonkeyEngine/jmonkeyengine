/**
 *  RPC service that can be added to a network Server to
 *  add RPC send/receive capabilities.  For a particular
 *  HostedConnection, Remote procedure calls can be made to the 
 *  associated Client and responses retrieved.  Any remote procedure 
 *  calls that the Client performs for this connection will be 
 *  received by this service and delegated to the appropriate RpcHandlers.
 *
 *  Note: it can be dangerous for a server to perform synchronous
 *  RPC calls to a client but especially so if not done as part
 *  of the response to some other message.  ie: iterating over all
 *  or some HostedConnections to perform synchronous RPC calls
 *  will be slow and potentially block the server's threads in ways
 *  that can cause deadlocks or odd contention.
