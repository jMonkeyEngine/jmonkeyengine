/**
 *  A service that can be added to the client to support a simple
 *  shared objects protocol.
 *
 *  <p>Objects are shared by adding them to the RmiRegistry with one of the
 *  share() methods.  Shared objects must have a separate interface and implementation.
 *  The interface is what the other end of the connection will use to interact
 *  with the object and that interface class must be available on both ends of
 *  the connection.  The implementing class need only be on the sharing end.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Shared objects can be accessed on the other end of the connection by
 *  using one of the RmiRegistry's getRemoteObject() methods.  These can be
 *  used to lookup an object by class if it is a shared singleton or by name
 *  if it was registered with a name.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>Note: This RMI implementation is not as advanced as Java's regular
 *  RMI as it won't marshall shared references, ie: you can't pass
 *  a shared objects as an argument to another shared object's method.</p>
