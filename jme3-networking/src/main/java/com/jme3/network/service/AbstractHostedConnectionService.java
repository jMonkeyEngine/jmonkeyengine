/**
 *  Convenient base class for HostedServices providing some default HostedService 
 *  interface implementations as well as a few convenience methods 
 *  such as getServiceManager() and getService(type).  This implementation
 *  enhances the default capabilities provided by AbstractHostedService by
 *  adding automatic connection management.
 * 
 *  <p>Subclasses must at least override the onInitialize(), startHostingOnConnection(), and
 *  stopHostingOnConnection() methods to handle service and connection initialization.</p>
 *
 *  <p>An autoHost flag controls whether startHostingOnConnection() is called
 *  automatically when new connections are detected.  If autoHohst is false then it
 *  is up to the implementation or appliction to specifically start hosting at 
 *  some point.</p>
